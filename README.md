## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Keyframes
- Animation

### What I learned

For this project, I added new functions that I was not familiar with like keyframes and animation, trying to explore new ways to make the design leaner and comfortable. I'm satisfied with the results of my efforts.

### Continued development

For my future projects, I want to explore even more ways to improve the sites design and delve myself into it in a way that I can work my creativity around it.

### Useful resources

- [Geeks for Geeks: Fade-in effect on page load using CSS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-fade-in-effect-on-page-load-using-css/) - This helped me to create the animation for the site, and I really recommend it if you're trying to build something similar.
